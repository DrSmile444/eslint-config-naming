# Playground

Use this page as a checklist for trying rules locally.

## 1) Add a scratch file

Create `playground.ts` with a few names you want to test.

## 2) Run ESLint

```bash
npx eslint playground.ts
```

## 3) Iterate

Use [Rule Precedence](/troubleshooting/rule-precedence) when results surprise you.
