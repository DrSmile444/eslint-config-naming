# Local functions (default)

**Selector:** `function`
Earlier allowance: `PascalCase` / `camelCase` with leading `_` allowed

But note: a later rule enforces **camelCase** for all functions. See [CamelCase enforcement](/rules/functions/camel-case-only).

## ✅ Good

```ts
function localFunction() {
  return 1;
}
```
