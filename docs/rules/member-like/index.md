# Member-like

**Selector:** `memberLike`

Member-like covers class fields, methods, accessors, etc. Rules depend on modifiers:

* `public` / `private` / `protected`
* `static`
* `readonly`

## Pages

* [Public static](/rules/member-like/public-static)
* [Private static](/rules/member-like/private-static)
* [Public](/rules/member-like/public)
* [Private](/rules/member-like/private)
* [Private readonly](/rules/member-like/private-readonly)
* [Protected](/rules/member-like/protected)

## Why this matters

Member naming is the most visible surface of your API—both inside and outside the class.
