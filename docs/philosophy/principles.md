# Principles

## 1) Readability over cleverness

Names should communicate intent without requiring context.

## 2) Consistency beats personal preference

A stable convention reduces cognitive load and review time.

## 3) Respect real-world interoperability

Destructuring and quoted keys exist; the rules should not fight your APIs.

## 4) BYO parser/options

Different repos require different parser settings; rules should not assume a single setup.
