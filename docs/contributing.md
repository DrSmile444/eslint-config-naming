# Contributing

## Philosophy

Changes should improve:

- readability
- consistency
- practical interoperability

## Proposing a change

1. Describe the problem
2. Provide before/after naming examples
3. Explain tradeoffs
4. Add/update tests for the selector

## What we avoid

- Overfitting to a single repo
- Breaking changes without a migration path
